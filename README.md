Nagios SNMP Location
====================

Nagios collects SNMP location of devices, saves it using memcached and displays it in notifications.

Requirements
------------

* Nagios
* Net-SNMP with python bindings
* Memcached
* py-memcached

Installation of Nagios plugin
-----------------------------

**Installation and general configuration of Nagios and Memcached is out of scope of this document. This only covers necessary configuration to introduce SNMP location.**

Put the Nagios plugin in the directory configured in resource.cfg, for example:
<pre>
# Sets $USER1$ to be the path to the plugins
$USER1$=/usr/local/libexec/nagios
</pre>

Define a check command in commands.cfg (SNMP community 'public' used below):
<pre>
# 'check_snmp_location' command definition
define command{
    command_name    check_snmp_location
    command_line    $USER1$/check_snmp_location.py -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -C public
}
</pre>

Create service checks for location, such as following:
<pre>
define service{
    use                     trivial-service   # Notifications disabled
    host_name               switch
    service_description     SNMP Location
    check_command           check_snmp_location
}
</pre>

__Make sure the user Nagios runs as can execute the script properly.__ If you access memcached through a UNIX socket, you might have to make memcached run as the nagios user so the socket file is accessible by Nagios.
<pre>
nagios# su -m nagios -c '/usr/local/libexec/nagios/check_snmp_location.py -H switch -C public'
</pre>

If it looks like a permission problem, chmod/chown the file so Nagios can run it. If it complains about not being able to extract python eggs, it might be because the user cannot create a '.python-eggs' directory in its home folder. You can either fix home folder permissions or extract the relevant eggs manually. Note: directory below is where python lays its eggs in FreeBSD:
<pre>
cd /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
mkdir egg-archive
unzip netsnmp_python-*.egg
mv netsnmp_python-*.egg ./egg-archive/
unzip python_memcached-*.egg
mv python_memcached-*.egg ./egg-archive/
</pre>

Notification integration
------------------------

We'd like to do something with the gathered information which is stored in memcached as a key:value pair with Nagios-defined host address as key and SNMP location as value.

Put the memcached_get.py script somewhere good, and modify Nagios notify command definitions in commands.cfg (change to fit your environment):
<pre>
# 'notify-host-by-email' command definition
define command{
        command_name    notify-host-by-email
        command_line    /usr/bin/printf "** Nagios System Surveillence **\n\nNotification Type: %b\nHost: %b\nState: %b\nAddress: %b\nInfo: %b\n\nDate/Time: %b\nLocation: %b" "$NOTIFICATIONTYPE$" "$HOSTNAME$" "$HOSTSTATE$" "$HOSTADDRESS$" "$HOSTOUTPUT$" "$LONGDATETIME$" "`/usr/local/bin/memcached_get.py $HOSTADDRESS$`" | /usr/bin/mail -s "Host $HOSTSTATE$ alert for $HOSTNAME$!" $CONTACTEMAIL$
}

# 'notify-by-email' command definition
define command{
        command_name    notify-by-email
        command_line    /usr/bin/printf "** Nagios System Surveillence **\n\nNotification Type: %b\n\nService: %b\nHost: %b\nAddress: %b\nState: %b\n\nDate/Time: %b\n\nAdditional Info:\n\n%b\nLocation: %b" "$NOTIFICATIONTYPE$" "$SERVICEDESC$" "$HOSTALIAS$" "$HOSTADDRESS$" "$SERVICESTATE$" "$LONGDATETIME$" "$SERVICEOUTPUT$" "`/usr/local/bin/memcached_get.py $HOSTADDRESS$`" | /usr/bin/mail -s "$NOTIFICATIONTYPE$ alert - $HOSTALIAS$/$SERVICEDESC$ is $SERVICESTATE$" $CONTACTEMAIL$
}
</pre>
